Meteor bootstrap-3-theme
==================

Provides the Bootstrap Theme from [Bootstrap 3.3.1](http://getbootstrap.com) to your [Meteor](http://meteor.com) app.

### Installation

With Meteor 0.9:

```sh
$ meteor add twbs:bootstrap
$ meteor add ian:bootstrap-3-theme
```

[twbs:bootstrap](https://atmospherejs.com/twbs/bootstrap) is the recommended Meteor implementation of Twitter's Bootstrap, and is declared as a weak dependency in this package. If you're using your own Bootstrap package, you'll have to make sure it loads before this one. You can submit a pull-request to add it as a weak-dependency if you wish.
